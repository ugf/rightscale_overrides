  "long_description": "= RightScale System Firewall Cookbook \n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nBuilt upon Opscode's 'iptables' cookbook. This cookbook provides a LWRP for\nmanaging access to multiple servers in a deployment using machine tags.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\nRequires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Use the <tt>sys_firewall::default</tt> recipe in conjunction with the\n  'Firewall' input to enable or disable iptables.\n* Use the <tt>sys_firewall::setup_rule</tt> recipe for enabling/disabling\n  specific firewall rules.\n* Use the <tt>sys_firewall::do_list_rules</tt> recipe to list the existing\n  firewall rules set up on the server.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General information\nWhen the firewall is enabled it is completely closed for incoming connections - only outbound connections are allowed.\n<tt>sys_firewall::default</tt> then opens 22, 80 and 443 ports by default (additionally on SoftLayer 48000..48020 ports\nare opened on the private 10.* network for the monitoring agent).\n\n=== Updating firewall rules using tags\n\nAll tag-based actions are scoped to the deployment.\n\n==== Update Action\n\nTo open a local port to all servers with a given tag use:\n\n  sys_firewall \"Open this server's ports to all servers with this 'tag' \" do\n    machine_tag \"servertag:active=true\"\n    port 3306\n    enable true\n    action :update\n  end\n  \nThis can be used when a server is booting to open up access for multiple systems\nat once.\n\n==== Update Request Action\n\nTo request that all servers with a given tag close a port to a given IP address use:\n\n  sys_firewall \"Request all app servers close ports to this load balancer\" do\n    machine_tag \"loadbalancer:app=www\"\n    port 8000\n    enable false\n    ip_addr node[:cloud][:private_ips][0]\n    action :update_request\n  end\n  \nThis can be useful when decommissioning a running server that had previously\nrequested ports opened.\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
